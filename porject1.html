		    <p> I feel lucky that I can cook a lot of food. Now when I am cooking some food that my children and my husband like, I become happy and I am proud of my mother and myself.
                In the beginning I cooked easy things. For example, I cooked eggs, but gradually I got better at making different and more difficult food.

		    <p> People are going to cooking, because some food is raw that people cannot eat it, because it is not tasty.
			    I do cooking because I am very interesting in cooking, also I will learn and know cooking every food. 
				We have many kind of food, some of them are good for health and some of them are not good for health.
